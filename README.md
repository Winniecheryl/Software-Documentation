# Software-Documentation

## Software development life cycle(documentation approaches)
There are two approaches; Waterfall and Agile 
### 1. Waterfall approach

The Waterfall technique is a sequential process with specific objectives for each development phase. In the early stages of a project, waterfall teams devote a significant amount of time to product planning. They draw up a detailed outline of the primary aims and objectives, as well as a plan for how the work will be done. Before beginning any engineering steps, waterfall teams aim to establish detailed documentation. For projects with few to no changes in progress, careful planning is beneficial since it allows for accurate budgeting and schedule estimations. Waterfall planning, on the other hand, has been shown to be unsuccessful for long-term development since it fails to account for potential changes and contingencies as they arise. The Waterfall technique is a sequential process with specific objectives for each stage.

### 2. Agile Approach

Teamwork, tight engagement with customers and stakeholders, adaptability, and the capacity to adjust swiftly to change are all hallmarks of the agile approach. Iterations are the fundamental components of agile development; each one involves planning, analysis, design, programming, and testing. The agile approach does not necessitate extensive documentation at the start. Because things can alter as the project progresses, managers don't need to prepare far ahead. Just-in-time planning is possible as a result. Putting â€“ "functioning software over thorough documentation -" as one of the Agile Manifesto ideals implies, the goal is to write documentation with information that is necessary to move forward when it makes the most sense.
